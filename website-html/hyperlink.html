    <P>
        Whales are one of the most amazing creatures that live in the planet. They inhabit all oceans of the world.
        Whales belong to the order cetacea, which means that they are mammals fully adapted to aquatic life. Like all
        cetaceans, including dolphins and porpoises, whales are descendants of land-living animals which returned to
        water after living millions of years in land.
    </P>
    <P>
        Most whales can grow to be extremely large. In fact, the Blue Whale is considered to be the largest animal in
        the world.
    </P>
    <P>
        There are two types of whales that are identified by scientists, baleen whales and toothed whales, having each
        of these categories many sub species. You can easily identify which category a whale belongs based on its
        feeding and physical characteristics.
    </P>
    <P>
        Whales have their own hierarchy in their groups that is very closely followed. They are excellent parents to
        their offspring and they are able to communicate with a variety of sounds. If you get the chance to closely
        observe whales you will quickly understand how they value their relationships with each other.

    <ul class="list2">
        <li>Baleen Whales
            <p>Baleen Whales make up the majority of them. They have a sieve structure in the jaw area that allows them
                to easily filter food out of water.</p>
            <ul class="list1">
                <li>Blue Whale</li>
                <li>Gray Whale</li>
                <li>Bowhead Whale</li>
                <li>Fin Whale</li>
                <li>Humpback Whale</li>
                <li>Minke Whale</li>

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Toothed Whales</li>
        <p>Toothed Whales are carnivorous and as their name implies they have teeth that allow them to easily hunt their
            prey.</p>
        <ul class="list1">
            <li>Sperm Whale</li>
            <li>Narwhal Whale</li>
