        Whales are one of the most amazing creatures that live in the planet. They inhabit all oceans of the world.
        Whales belong to the order cetacea, which means that they are mammals fully adapted to aquatic life. Like all
        cetaceans, including dolphins and porpoises, whales are descendants of land-living animals which returned to
        water after living millions of years in land.

        Most whales can grow to be extremely large. In fact, the Blue Whale is considered to be the largest animal in
        the world.
